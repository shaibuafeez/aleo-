# 🌍 Move By Practice - Democratizing Blockchain Education Across Africa

## The African Opportunity Gap

As global blockchain focus shifts to Western markets, **Africa's 1.4 billion people risk being left behind** in the Web3 revolution—despite having the fastest-growing youth tech population.

**Current Barriers:**
- ❌ $2,000+ cost for bootcamps and travel to tech hubs
- ❌ Limited access to high-end PCs for development
- ❌ Complex setup (CLI, wallets, nodes) takes days
- ❌ No local instructors or real-time support
- ❌ English-only content excludes 80% of potential developers

**The Result:** Africa's brightest minds are locked out of the $3T blockchain economy.

## Why This Matters for Sui Ecosystem

### Problem: Brain Drain
African developers leave the continent (or blockchain entirely) due to lack of accessible education.

### Solution: Retain & Grow Local Talent
- **Keep impact in Africa** - developers build locally, create African solutions
- **Reduce costs** - no travel, no expensive hardware, no bootcamp fees
- **Scale faster** - reach millions vs. hundreds
- **Reduce risk** - stable, predictable growth vs. one-off events

### Network Effects:
```
1 African developer trained → Teaches 10 friends → Builds 3 dApps → Hires 2 juniors
= 100x ROI on education investment
```
