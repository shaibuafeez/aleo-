## SLIDE 2: The Problem

# Africa is Being Left Behind

### As blockchain focus shifts West, 1.4B Africans face barriers:

- ❌ **$2,000+** bootcamp & travel costs
- ❌ **$800+** laptop requirement
- ❌ **4+ hours** complex setup
- ❌ **Zero** local instructors
- ❌ **English-only** content (excludes 80%)

### Result:
**Africa's brightest minds locked out of the $3T blockchain economy**

---

## SLIDE 3: The Opportunity Cost

# What Africa Loses Without Action

```
Traditional Education Path in Africa:
├─ Travel to bootcamp → $500-$2,000
├─ Buy laptop → $800+
├─ Install tools → 4+ hours
├─ Find tutorials → English only
└─ 85% quit before deploying

Total Cost: $3,000+
Success Rate: 15%
Time: Weeks/months
```

**We're training the Western world while Africa watches**
