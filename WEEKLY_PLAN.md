# 📊 Last Week — Oct 16 – 22, 2025

### ✅ Completed
- Fixed UI inconsistencies (lesson cards, stat spacing, color scheme)
- Replaced homepage CTA with "Become a move dev"
- Implemented 7 complete lessons with full content

### ⚠️ Pending
- Compiler still using basic parser (no WASM)
- No AI assistance for stuck students
- Analytics dashboard missing
- No backend persistence (local only)

### 💡 Learnings
- Students need more guided help when debugging
- Progress tracking motivation is critical
- Need to fix lesson count inconsistency (14 vs 18)

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Focus on compiler + AI assistance (biggest UX impact)
- Add dashboard for retention
- Complete remaining 7 lessons
