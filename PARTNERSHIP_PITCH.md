# 🚀 Move By Practice - Partnership Pitch Deck

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current State of Blockchain Education
- **High Barrier to Entry**: Traditional blockchain development requires complex setup (CLI tools, wallets, nodes)
- **Limited Talent Pool**: Only ~200K blockchain developers globally vs. 27M total developers
- **Poor Learning Experience**: Existing resources are fragmented, outdated, or purely theoretical
- **Slow Onboarding**: Takes weeks/months for developers to ship their first smart contract
- **Zero Retention**: 85% of developers abandon blockchain learning within 30 days

### Market Opportunity
- **$3.2B** - Global blockchain education market by 2027
- **68%** - Year-over-year growth in Web3 job postings
- **14x** - Developer multiplier effect (1 trained dev enables 14 projects)
- **Sui Ecosystem**: 300K+ monthly active users but <1,000 active Move developers
